# randommusiclel
- Pretty *not very useful*.
- Just for fun.
- All the music and pictures on the site is not mine, you can search for them on google and buy a copy to help the artist.
- I don't know why google chrome said that the website is not safe but it's definitely safe because I don't collect anything.
- Feel free to contribute to this shitty repo because it's still having bugssssss.
- Link to the website: [randommusiclul](https://randommusiclul.herokuapp.com) (Hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)).
- I made this to I learn node js so ..... It will probably not be updated.



+ Note: It's not accessible sometimes (try to reload it after a minute) because the online time has a limit in a month because I'm using a free host.
+ Another note: I don't know why sometimes the website don't play sounds.
